# Privacy Policy for Gaming Tracker

**Last Updated**: February 24, 2025

Thank you for using **Gaming Tracker** (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our App. Please read this policy carefully.

## 1. Data Stored Locally
The App stores gaming session data locally on your device. This data includes:
- Game titles.
- Session durations.
- Power modes used during sessions (Balanced/Performance/Turbo).
- Fan modes applied during sessions (Auto/Custom/Max).
- Average fan speed of the CPU and GPU during sessions.

All data is stored on your device and is **not transmitted to us or any third parties**. The App relies on local file storage (Dart objects stored as JSON strings in organized text files) for persistence.

## 2. No Data Collection or Sharing
The App does **not** collect, transmit, or share any personal or non-personal data with us or third parties. All data entered into the App remains on your device unless you choose to delete it.

---

## 3. User Control
You have full control over the data stored in the App. You can:
- View, edit, or delete individual gaming sessions.
- Delete all sessions for a specific day.
- Manage registered games (add, edit, or delete them).

To delete data:
- Navigate to the "Today's Games" page and use the delete icon (red trash can) to remove individual sessions or all sessions for a specific day.
- Use the delete icon on the "Games" page to remove a registered game (this does not affect existing session data for that game).

## 4. Third-Party Services
The App does **not** use any third-party services (e.g., ads, analytics, or cloud storage) that collect user data. All features of the App are self-contained and operate entirely offline.
